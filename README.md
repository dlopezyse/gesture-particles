# Hand-Gesture 3D Particles 🖐️✨

A real-time interactive 3D particle system that responds to hand gestures via webcam. Built to explore the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Web-based 3D Graphics**.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [Link will appear here after GitHub Pages setup]

## 🚀 Features

* **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks directly in the browser.
* **Gesture Interaction:**
    * **Tension:** Closing your fist creates a "gravitational pull," collapsing the particles.
    * **Scale:** Moving two hands apart zooms the universe in/out.
* **Procedural Morphology:** Mathematical generation of 3D shapes (Heart, Saturn, Lotus, Torus Knot).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Three.js** (WebGL Rendering)
* **MediaPipe Hands** (Google AI Edge)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (No bundlers, single-file architecture)

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This prototype was conceptually engineered and coded using **Gemini 3**. The goal was to test the capabilities of LLMs in generating complex, interactive graphical interfaces from natural language prompts.
